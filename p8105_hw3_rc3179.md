## Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The Instacart dataset shows that there are a total of 1384617
observations/rows across 131209 unique orders placed on Instacart. Each
observation or row represents an item order, and there are 15 variables
or columns which include order\_id, product\_id, add\_to\_cart\_order,
reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number, order\_dow,
order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order, product\_name,
aisle\_id, department\_id, aisle, department. These variables include
information on when the items were ordered, which user ordered it, how
often it has been reordered, along with information on the item itself
such as the name or department/aisle it is in. There are 21 unique
departments from alcohol to snacks. There are a total of 39123 unique
products available, with orders placed between the hours of 0 and 23

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_orders = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_orders))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                         n_orders
    ##    <chr>                            <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables                150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                    150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits       78493
    ##  4 yogurt                           55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                  41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water    36617
    ##  7 milk                             32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                   31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                  26240
    ## 10 bread                            23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

There are a total of 134 aisles and fresh vegetables and fresh fruits,
respectively, are the top 2 aisles which have the most items ordered
from them.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_orders = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_orders > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_orders)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle", caption = "(min 10000 items), arranged alphabetically") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))
```

Table of 3 most popular items in aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food
care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == 'baking ingredients' | aisle == "dog food care" | aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n_orders = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_orders)) %>% 
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(n_orders))) %>% 
  filter(rank <= 3) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour_of_day = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour_of_day
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Problem 2

Cleaning the data to format variable names, focus on “Overall Health”,
including only “Excellent” to “Poor” responses, and organizing as
factors ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss_smart2010 = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health" & 
           (response == "Excellent" | response == "Very good" |
              response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | response == "Poor")) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = factor(response),
    response = fct_relevel(response, "Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good")
  )

brfss_smart2010 
```

    ## # A tibble: 10,625 x 23
    ##     year locationabbr locationdesc class topic question response
    ##    <int> <chr>        <chr>        <chr> <chr> <chr>    <fct>

    ##  3  2010 AL           AL - Jeffer… Heal… Over… How is … Good

    ##  5  2010 AL           AL - Jeffer… Heal… Over… How is … Poor

    ##  8  2010 AL           AL - Mobile… Heal… Over… How is … Good    
    ##  9  2010 AL           AL - Mobile… Heal… Over… How is … Fair

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr, locationdesc) %>% 
  summarize(n = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  count(locationabbr) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 2
    ## # Groups:   locationabbr [6]
    ##   locationabbr     n
    ##   <chr>        <int>
    ## 1 CT               7
    ## 2 FL               7
    ## 3 MA               8
    ## 4 NC               7
    ## 5 NJ               8
    ## 6 PA              10

In 2002, CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, and PA were observed at 7 or more locations

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr, locationdesc) %>% 
  summarize(n = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  count(locationabbr) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 14 x 2
    ## # Groups:   locationabbr [14]
    ##    locationabbr     n
    ##    <chr>        <int>

    ## 13 TX              16
    ## 14 WA              10

In 2010, CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA were
observed at 7 or more locations

  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, response, data_value) %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(mean_data_value = mean(data_value)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_data_value, color = locationabbr)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = locationabbr)) +

## Problem 3

``` r
accel_data = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_v_weekend = case_when(
      (day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday") ~ "weekend",
      TRUE ~ "weekday"
    )
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

In the accelerometer dataset, there are a total of total of 35 rows/day
where each row represents a day of activities/accelerometer data. There
is information on the week, day, day of the week, along with data on up
to 1440 activities, for a total of 1444 variables, with the addition of
the weekday vs weekend variable.

``` r
#accel_data %>% 
#  group_by(day) %>% 
#  summarize(sum = rowSums[4:1443])
```

``` r
#accel_data %>% 
#  group_by(day)
#  ggplot(aes(x = day_id, y = sum, color = day)) +
#    geom_point()
```
